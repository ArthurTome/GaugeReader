# GAUGE AND ROTAMETER 

Reading analog values from flow sensors is a problem for industrial applications that require constant readings

That is why using computer vision to get continuous values from analog displays is an economical solution

> **Note**
> This program was developed as an application study

### PROJECT PROGRESS
- [ ] OpenCV to get images from webcam
- [ ] Processing images to get parameters
- [ ] Get the dial position
- [ ] Read the dial scale
- [ ] Print values and show them on the display
- [ ] Communicate read values to another application
- [ ] .. updates in progress
